# Man Pages Guide

Since discovering and embracing *man* pages, I am frequently surprised
by new discoveries.

There are many *man* pages that extaordinarily useful, yet may be rarely
used.

## Some Useful *Man* Pages

There are pages that reward occasional browsing.  I write a lot of
BASH scripts, so I'm pretty comfortable with the builtin functions I
frequently use.  However, when I found `man builtins`, I could see
all the builtin functions with short descriptions.  This new
information introduces me to new possibilities.

- `man syscalls` summarizes functions used to interact with the Linux
  kernel.

- `man builtins` BASH builtin commands

## Find-Your-Own Man Pages

Man pages are found in directories under */usr/share/man*, named
*man1*, *man2*, etc. according to the *man* section that invokes the
content.  While some of these directories are pretty large, browsing
*man* page names might trigger an interest in an unfamiliar topic.
